# plan

- get a copy of some sort of trace data
- figure a better format for chreod data, maybe just tab delim
- write utility for converting

- figure and grab osm data subset for new york
- figure specification for street network, intersections as nodes,
  streets and models of connections between the two
- convert OSM data to a street network

- figure out how to calculate distance between a point and a line
  model
- figure an alignment algorithm to assing points to street segments
